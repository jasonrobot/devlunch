# Devlunch Picker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jasonrobot/devlunch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jasonrobot/devlunch)

Nothing fancy here, just a small website built with ruby on rails, mostly as a learning excercise (I've learned a lot). Its pretty much going to be a continual work in progress. Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests if you want to fix something.

Feedback is appreciated, but not too much because I'm having fun learning for myself.

## What it does:
The idea is that you can sign up to either get a chance to pick where lunch will be, or to just come along without the pressure of having to pick. You can use the rake tasks pick and reset in scheduler.rake to trigger the random pick of who wins and to reset the voting.
